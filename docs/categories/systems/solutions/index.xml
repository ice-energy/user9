      <description>Because every Mad (Computer) Scientist needs their Hardware Wall-Mounted!
I put together this computer largely from spare parts and Amazon points from my Amex. So barely cost anything, and I thought it would be perfect as a server for Zoneminder.
This was built with the intention of putting it in an enclosure. It started out sitting on my bookshelf, where I used some half-inch standoffs to raise it up. Here&amp;rsquo;s a pic:</description>

      <description>Quick Summary: An off-the-shelf external controller may be used to interface directly with the CDC controller to control the IceBears&amp;rsquo; cycle of Making Ice and Providing Cooling. An example scenario will be shown using a PLC-type controller with a Modbus interface that is used to control an IceBear AND ALSO extract data from it.
CDC Controller GPIO Inputs: The CDC controller has 8 GPIO inputs as shown in the above picture:</description>
